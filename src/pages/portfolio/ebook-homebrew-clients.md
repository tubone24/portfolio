## Native Apps

We also create applications using Flutter as a Native App client.

Because cross-platform Native App development with Flutter has been realized, it is an application that can run on both Android and iOS.

In addition, unit testing with Flutter Test Suite, automated testing and building with CircleCI, and automated tester distribution of post-build deliverables with Deploy Gate.
