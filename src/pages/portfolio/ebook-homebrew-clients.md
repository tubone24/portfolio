We have created many useful client applications that utilize the API provided by Ebook-homebrew.

## Web Client

Created a web client using Vue.js, Vuex, TypeScript as the web client.

Support your Ebook creation with SPA operation feeling and futuristic design.

In addition, this project provides automated testing using Jest and CircleCI, and automated deployment using heroku.

## Native Apps

We also create applications using Flutter as a Native App client.

Because cross-platform Native App development with Flutter has been realized, it is an application that can run on both Android and iOS.

In addition, unit testing with Flutter Test Suite, automated testing and building with CircleCI, and automated tester distribution of post-build deliverables with Deploy Gate.
