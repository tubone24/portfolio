## What is SottoMe?

SottoMe is a digital self-care application that helps users track and reflect on their mood and daily activities using techniques inspired by Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (**CBT**). It integrates artificial intelligence to support emotional awareness and personal reflection directly through the app interface.

## Key Features

- Mood and Activity Logging: Users can record daily emotions, activities, and schedules — then visualize patterns over time.
- AI Navigator: An AI assistant engages users in interactive dialogues, helps interpret emotional patterns, and provides supportive feedback — without offering medical diagnosis or treatment.
- Automatic Thought Records: The app facilitates CBT-style automatic thought tracking when users note negative emotions, helping users reconsider cognitive patterns with optional AI guidance.
